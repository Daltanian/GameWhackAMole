# GameWhackAMole
An enhanced browser-based Whack-A-Mole game complete with streak multipliers, lives, and light-weight audio feedback.

## Gameplay Features

- **Lives & misses** – start each run with three hearts. Missing a mole or triggering a bomb costs a life.
- **Combo multiplier** – consecutive successful hits ramp up a score multiplier for big points.
- **Special moles** – golden moles award bonus points, bombs subtract points and take a life.
- **Adaptive pacing** – moles surface faster as you keep the streak alive.
- **Keyboard & mouse support** – click holes or use the numpad (7-9 / 4-6 / 1-3) to whack.
- **Persistent best score** – high scores are saved locally in your browser.
- **Soundscape** – synthesized sound effects with optional background ambience (toggleable in-game).

## Assets

Place custom music files in `assets/music/` and sound effects in `assets/sfx/`. Update the HTML if you wish to use file-based audio instead of the generated tones.
